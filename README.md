## Running locally

There are two ways to run it - from sources or from binaries.

### Running from binaries
- go to [releases page](https://github.com/spolnik/JAlgoArena-Ranking/releases) and download last app package (JAlgoArena-Ranking-[version_number].zip)
- after unpacking it, go to folder and run `./run.sh` (to make it runnable, invoke command `chmod +x run.sh`)
- you can modify port in run.sh script, depending on your infrastructure settings. The script itself can be found in here: [run.sh](run.sh)

### Running from sources
- run `git clone https://github.com/spolnik/JAlgoArena-Ranking` to clone locally the sources
- now, you can build project with command `./gradlew clean stage` which will create runnable jar package with app sources. Next, run `java -jar build/libs/jalgoarena-auth-*.jar` which will start application
- there is second way to run app with gradle. Instead of running above, you can just run `./gradlew clean bootRun`
